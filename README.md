# frontend-backendproject
hello,
this is the first project where I used the frontend and backend fully, the aim of this project is a simple user login-registration and feedback in case of errors, and the end provides token feedback. html-css-java and python languages ​​were used in the project, python was used as the backend and html-css-js was used as the frontend.
to run the project, first open the command prompt and cd "enter the backend file directory" then say uvicorn main:app --reload, then enter your host address, execute your post or other process from fastapi and run the html file, then the project will be ready to run.
good luck!
